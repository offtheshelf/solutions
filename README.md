# Off The Shelf Technology

Off The Shelf Technologies provides technology solutions for the autonomous driving space.

We offer a spectrum of high end IMU, GPS and LIDAR technologies, as well as custom, contract and turnkey solutions.

## LIDAR

we sell you LIDAR for cheap.
Lasers go roundy-roundy like lucky wheel of fortune to give you more better data.
We call this the Lucky Jade Dragon Imperial Fortune.

## TurnKey Data Acquisition Apparatus

Off The Shelf provides the first commercially available rig for collecting 3D point cloud data.
The rig mounts on top of the vehicle (example) with 360-degree coverage for LIDAR data and undistorted camera images.
Our system of overlapping 90-degree HFOV cameras deliver JPEG compressed images at 20-60 FPS (frames per second),
synchronous to a system of 1 (up to 4) LIDAR components.
Our apparatus synchronously integrates quad IMU subsystems with RTK-GPS to provide
automotive grade point cloud data with 2cm - 5cm precision, even in GPS-challenged areas.

Point cloud and camera data can be used for detecting street signs, potholes, lanes, crosswalk, traffic signals, 
pedestrians, bicycles, etc.
Combined with an inward-facing in-cabin camera, the client can correlate driver behavior with external conditions.

Data is streamed over gigabit ethernet, either with UDP or TCP protocols.
