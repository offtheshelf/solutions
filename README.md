# Off The Shelf Technology

Off The Shelf Technologies provides technology solutions for the autonomous driving space.

We offer a spectrum of high end IMU, GPS and LIDAR technologies, as well as custom, contract and turnkey solutions.

## LIDAR

we sell you LIDAR for cheap.
Lasers go roundy-roundy like lucky wheel of fortune to give you more better data.
We call this the Lucky Jade Dragon Imperial Fortune.

## TurnKey Data Acquisition Apparatus

Off The Shelf provides the first commercially available data acquisition rig for collecting 3D point cloud data.
The geometric form factor is highly configurable.
The most simple device comprises a single 16-channel LIDAR with a single camera.
The most comprehensive device comprises 4 16-channel LIDAR, and 8 cameras providing double stereoscopic coverage.
All configurations include tightly coupled RTK-GPS and IMU solutions.
(Note: this stereoscopic lidar option provides an advantage over a simple 64-channel LIDAR system).
The device mounts on top of the vehicle (example) with 360-degree coverage for LIDAR data 
and undistorted 360&deg; camera images.
Our 720&deg; stereoscopic camera (patent pending) images provide stereoscopic functionality with 360&deg; coverage.
Our system of overlapping 60&deg;-90&deg; HFOV cameras deliver raw data or JPEG compressed images at 20-60 FPS,
synchronous to a system of 1 (up to 4) LIDAR components.
Our apparatus synchronously integrates quad IMU subsystems with RTK-GPS to provide
automotive grade point cloud data with 2cm - 5cm precision, even in GPS-challenged areas.

    2. (A)RGB
    3. YUV
    4. JPEG compressed
* Lidar Options
    1. single 16-laser
    2. stereo 16-lidar system (optional z-axis staggering)
    3. quad 16-lidar system (recommended z-axis staggering)
* Lidar data delivered in 
    1. PCAP file format
    2. (R, &phi;, &theta;)
    3. (x, y, z)

Point cloud and camera data can be used for detecting street signs, potholes, lanes, crosswalk, traffic signals, 
pedestrians, bicycles, etc.
Combined with an inward-facing in-cabin camera, the client can correlate driver behavior with external conditions.

Data is streamed over gigabit ethernet, either with UDP or TCP protocols.
